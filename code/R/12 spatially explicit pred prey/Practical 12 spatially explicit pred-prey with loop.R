#########################################
### This augemnted piece of code includes a facility to ease varying one (or more) parameters systematically, and recording the outcomes.  I set it up to vary Nspeed in 100-unit steps from 100 to 1200. I run 10 replicate simulations of each Nspeed, for 120 runs in total. This takes approximately 10 seconds to run on my lap top. 

#	Note that the parameter definitions MUST be modified to accomodate the systematically varying parameters. See below how I do this (Line 28)

# 	Note that you want to turn off plotting entirely if you use this. 

# 	Note that at the bottom of this modified script are some ways to visualise the output. You'll want to make any output into an attractive figure(s) or table.
